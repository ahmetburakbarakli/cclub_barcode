You need to use buttons in order to use other functions. I will explain functions of the all buttons. Although it looks like there are 5 button, actually there are 6 in main layout.

### Send
Name says all. Whenever you click on this button, sends barcode in the edittext to the server.

### Attendees
Shows the list of names, surnames and barcodes (in a string form) of attendees. 

### Stats
It shows not only the total number of the attendees but also number of attendees in a session for all sessions

### Random Person
You can enter some criterion, and then, app shows a attendee who comply with selected criteria.

### About
Shows the "detailed" information about developers. 

### Nyan Cat Image
You are shocked, right? That was unexpected. You are right. How can you expect a nyan cat will do something? However, this nyan cat is special. Whenever you click on it, a wild scanner activity appears. Thus, you can scan a qr codes. https://github.com/dm77/barcodescanner is used for scanning.
