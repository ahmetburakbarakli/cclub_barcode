pre-v0.0.3

Removed unnecessary imports

v0.0.3
'compile' is changed with implementation as 'compile' is obsolete and it will be removed at the end of 2018. We need to keep our app up-to-date ^^
Added a part to get random participant for giveaways.
Finalized application for "Bilişim Günü'18" but this app can be used for different events. Thus, I assume v0.0.3 will be not final version.
